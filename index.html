<h1>AI creating the future</h1>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<text>Artificial Intelligence(AI) refers to the stimulaton of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exibhits traits associated with human mind such as learning and problem-solving.AI is shaping the future of humanity acriss nearly every industry. It is already the main driver of emerging technologies like big data, robotics and IoT and it will continue to act as a technological innovator for the forseeable future. Most of the innovations in AI will take place in the following 3 domains-

<h1>Computer Vision</h1>
<text>1) Self driving cars- CV may help self driving cars understand their surroundings and thereby drive the passengers safely to their destination, avoding potential collissions and accidents. </text>
<br/>
<text>2) Manufacturing- CV may help production lines and digitize processes and workers in the manufacturing indsutry.</text>
<br/>
<text>3) Facial recognition-CV algorithms may identify facial features in images and correlate them with the databse of face profiles.</text>

<h1>Data science</h1>
<text> 1) Internet Search- Many search engines may use data science to comprehend users' behaviour and search habits and to further provide the best search results.</text>
<br/>
<text>2) Healthcare- Doctors can use Deep learning Algorithms to detect and identify medical concers by feeding them medical images like MRI, X-rays and CT scans.</text>
<br/>
<text>3) Logistics- Big data analytics in logistics may play a significant role in dynamic route planning.</text>

<h1>Natural language processing</h1>
<text>1) A technology called Interactive Voice Response which is a part of NLP allows disabled people to communicate with machines more easily.</text>
<br/>
<text> 2) Deisease Prediction- NLP algorithms can provide doctors with information concerning progressing illnesses such as depression or schizophrenia by interpreting speech patterns.</text>
<br/>
<text> 3) Sentiment Analysis- Sentiment Analysis is the investigation of statements  in terms of their sentiments. More sophisticated NLP algorithms may be able to discern the emotions behind a statement.</text>
